## Overview
This project is a Rust-based application that provides a backend API for managing user data. It includes functionality for creating, retrieving, and managing users in a database.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

```
api
├── Cargo.toml               # Rust project configuration
├── README.md                # Project documentation
├── migrations                # Database migration scripts
│   └── 20231010120000_create_users_table.sql  # Migration for users table
└── src                      # Source code
    ├── main.rs             # Entry point of the application
    └── models              # Data models
        └── user.rs         # User model definition
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd api
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed. Then run:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

3. **Run Migrations**
   Execute the SQL migration to create the necessary database tables:
   ```bash
   # Assuming you have a database setup
   psql -U <username> -d <database_name> -f migrations/20231010120000_create_users_table.sql
   ```

4. **Run the Application**
   Start the application using:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

## Usage
Once the application is running, you can interact with the API to manage users. Refer to the API documentation for specific endpoints and usage examples.
